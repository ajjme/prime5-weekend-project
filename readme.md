This weekend I realized I have way too high expectations of my styling. When I write the JS and HTML, I think of it as "I just have to get this functional and working," then I'll just add the styling. Then when I want to add the styling, my expectations are way beyond my ability, usually, so I start researching it all. Basically I need to start applying the "just do a little bit at a time" to build my styling into something I want, instead of starting with the end in mind, I think.

I also am not so sure about Mongo. I can't see any instances in which I would be happy I was using Mongo instead of SQL. I'm sure there are some, but I don't quite see it. Basically anything I want to use Mongo for, I have to figure out how to duplicate things I take for granted in Postgres, like joins, etc.

I do really feel like I get services and angular now, though. So I'm glad about that.
